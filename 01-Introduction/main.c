    // Operating Systems.
    // Operating System is a program, that manages, the computer hardware.
    // It also provides a basis for application programs, and acts as an
    // intermediary between computer user and computer hardware.

    // What is computer hardware?
    // Computer hardware is basically electronic devices liek RAM, CPU,
    // I/O devices, etc... attached to the motherboard.

    // Software
    // There are 2 types of software.
    // 1. System Software
    // 2. Application Software

    // System Software
    // System softwares are the software that are used to command directly the system.
    // Basically directly hardware.
    // Operating system is also a system software.
    // Drivers are also system softwares.
    
    // Application Software
    // Application softwares are used to perform a specific task.
    // Like, text editor is a application program used to write text.
    // Compilers are also application softwares, like they are used to
    // compile language code.
    
    // Basically the Operating System is kind of a translator,
    // Which will translate from both sides.
    // Like when we have to write code, we open a text editor,
    // using Operating System, and when we save the file,
    // The operating system tells computer hardware that write this thing,
    // into hard drive. Etc...

    // Types of Operating System:
    // Batch OS
    // Time sharing OS
    // Distributed OS
    // Network OS
    // Real time OS
    // Multi Programming / Tasking / Processing OS
    // etc...
    
    // These are the main types of Operating Systems.

    // Some Functions of OS:
    // It is an interface between User and Hardware.
    // Allocation of Resources.
    // Management of Memory, Security, etc...

    // Operating System gives us Convenience of using Computer.
